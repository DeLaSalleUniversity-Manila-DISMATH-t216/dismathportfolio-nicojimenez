#WEEK 1
* First day of school. First subject = __DISMATH__ (Discrete Mathematics)
* I heard a lot about this subject. Some say it's as simple as 1 + 1, some also say its mind-blowing.
* When Sir Cabatuan introduced DISMATH, I thought it was going to be like 3rd year Geometry with the conditional statements and 4th year Physics with the logic gates.
* He also introduced us to words like Propositions, Logical Deduction, Axioms.
* Sir Cabatuan also said that in DISMATH, emotions should not get in the way of logic.

#WEEK 2
* I was re-enlightened with the topic about Logical Connectives/Logical Operators.
* Although I already had a background regarding this topic, it seems a bit more complicated.
* The Logical Connectives are Negation, Conjunction, Disjunction, Exclusive Or, Conditional, and Biconditional.
* Sometimes, I get lost when Sir gives us complex examples because I let my brain think about it which just makes things harder to reason out.
* I also learned the different Logical Equivalences.

#WEEK 3
* We were taught about Predicate Logic, and Quantifiers.
* Universal Quantifiers = "For All"
* Existential Quantifiers = "There Exists"
